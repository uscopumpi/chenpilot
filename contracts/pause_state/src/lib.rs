#![no_std]

//! Composable pause-state standard for Soroban contracts.
//!
//! A single, reusable pattern for emergency pause/unpause so behaviour is
//! consistent across the contract suite instead of every contract growing
//! its own ad-hoc boolean flag (as `core_vault`'s `BackendOnline` /
//! `UpgradeMode` and `rbac`'s unimplemented `emergency_pause` stub had
//! started to do independently, with no shared storage key, no shared
//! event shape, and no way for one contract to check another's pause state).
//!
//! ## What this gives you
//!
//! - A standard storage key (`PauseState`) and a small `PauseInfo` record
//!   (paused flag + who paused it + when, for audit purposes).
//! - `pause()` / `unpause()` — state transitions that emit a standard event
//!   and are idempotent-safe to call (pausing an already-paused contract or
//!   unpausing an already-unpaused one fails loudly via `PauseError`
//!   rather than silently no-op'ing, since a caller expecting a state
//!   change should know if nothing changed).
//! - `require_not_paused()` — the guard contracts call at the top of any
//!   state-changing entry point.
//! - `is_paused()` — a plain read, safe to call from a `#[contractclient]`
//!   trait so a *different* deployed contract can check this one's pause
//!   state before proceeding (see "Cross-contract pause checks" below).
//!
//! ## Wiring it into a contract
//!
//! 1. Add `pause_state = { path = "../pause_state" }` to `Cargo.toml`.
//! 2. In the contract's `DataKey` enum, DO NOT add a `Paused` variant —
//!    `pause_state` owns its own storage key (`PauseState`) so the standard
//!    stays identical across contracts and doesn't collide with
//!    contract-specific `DataKey` numbering. Storage is namespaced by
//!    contract instance already (each deployed contract has its own
//!    storage), so there's no collision risk between contracts.
//! 3. Gate state-changing entry points with
//!    `pause_state::require_not_paused(&env)` as the first line (after
//!    `require_auth()` checks, so an unauthenticated caller doesn't learn
//!    the pause state from an error, and before any storage reads/writes).
//! 4. Expose `pause()` / `unpause()` / `is_paused()` on the contract's own
//!    `#[contractimpl]` surface, delegating to this crate, gated by
//!    whatever admin/role check the contract already uses (this crate does
//!    NOT perform authorization — see "Design decision: no built-in auth"
//!    below).
//!
//! ## Cross-contract pause checks
//!
//! A dependent contract (e.g. `flash_loan_guard` depending on `core_vault`
//! being unpaused before it trusts a price snapshot) checks another
//! contract's pause state the same way any other cross-contract read
//! works in Soroban: via a `#[contractclient]` trait pointed at the
//! dependency's `is_paused` entry point.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use soroban_sdk::{contractclient, Address, Env};
//!
//! #[contractclient(name = "PausableClient")]
//! pub trait PausableTrait {
//!     fn is_paused(env: Env) -> bool;
//! }
//!
//! fn require_dependency_not_paused(env: &Env, dependency: &Address) {
//!     let client = PausableClient::new(env, dependency);
//!     if client.is_paused() {
//!         env.panic_with_error(pause_state::PauseError::DependencyPaused);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is a same-transaction, synchronous cross-contract call — it reflects
//! the dependency's pause state as of the current ledger, with the same
//! atomicity guarantees as any other Soroban cross-contract call (if the
//! dependency's state changes later in the same transaction after this
//! check, that's a normal reentrancy consideration, not specific to pause
//! state). It does NOT need `require_auth` since `is_paused` is a read-only
//! query with no side effects — see `PauseState::pause`/`unpause` below for
//! the entry points that do need authorization at the caller's contract.
//!
//! ## Design decision: no built-in auth
//!
//! This module deliberately does not call `require_auth()` or check any
//! role/admin address itself. Every contract in this workspace already has
//! its own admin/role model (`core_vault`'s legacy `Admin` + `UnifiedAuth`
//! integration, `rbac`'s `EmergencyAdmin` role, `flash_loan_guard`'s
//! `Config.admin`, ...) and duplicating or trying to unify those here would
//! be a much larger, riskier change than this issue calls for. Instead,
//! `pause()`/`unpause()` are meant to be called from inside a contract
//! method that has already performed its own authorization — this module
//! only owns the storage/event mechanics of the pause flag itself.
//!
//! ## Design decision: a standalone error enum, not `contract_failure`
//!
//! This module has its own `#[contracterror]` enum (`PauseError`) instead
//! of adding variants to `contract_failure::FailureReason`, which every
//! other contract in this workspace uses. That crate's `FailureReason` is
//! already at 65 variants — Soroban's contract-spec format caps a single
//! `#[contracterror]` enum's error cases at 50
//! (`ScSpecUdtErrorEnumV0.cases: VecM<_, 50>` in `stellar-xdr`), so
//! `contract_failure` as committed does not compile (`cargo check -p
//! contract_failure` panics inside the `#[contracterror]` macro with
//! `LengthExceedsMax`, independent of anything in this crate — reproduced
//! against the untouched file). Adding to it would make an already-broken
//! situation worse and this module's own tests unrunnable; splitting
//! `FailureReason` itself back under 50 is a real fix but is a much larger,
//! cross-cutting change (it's imported by all 17 contracts in the
//! workspace) that belongs in its own issue, not bundled into a pause
//! standard. A small, self-contained error enum keeps this module
//! independently compilable and testable regardless of that pre-existing
//! problem, and is a reasonable design on its own merits — a reusable
//! module arguably shouldn't be coupled to one specific consumer's error
//! enum anyway.
