## Test Results

```
PASS  src/__tests__/feeBumping.test.ts
  FeeBumpingEngine
    constructor and configuration
      ✓ should create engine with default config
      ✓ should create engine with custom strategy
    getDefaultLimits
      ✓ should return default resource limits
    estimateFee
      ✓ should estimate fee for given limits
    calculateAdjustment
      ✓ should return null for non-resource errors
      ✓ should calculate adjustment for CPU instructions error
    bumpAndRetry
      ✓ should succeed on first attempt
      ✓ should retry on resource error and succeed
      ✓ should fail after max attempts
      ✓ should not retry on non-resource errors
      ✓ should use custom initial limits
      ✓ should call onBump callback when bumping
