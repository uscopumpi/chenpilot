## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Find an Issue

Look at our [Issues list](https://github.com/chen-pilot/chen-pilot-experimental/issues) for tasks labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`. We have a roadmap of 50 priority issues focused on building a world-class **DeFi Agent on Stellar** (Yield strategies, Portfolio management, and Protocol integrations).

### 2. Creating a Pull Request

- Create a branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
- Commit your changes using **Conventional Commits**:
  - `feat: add automated yield farming strategy`
  - `fix: resolve profit calculation bug in portfolio tool`
  - `docs: update strategy contribution guide`
- Push to your fork and submit a PR to `main`.

## 📐 Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Tools**: All new tools should extend `BaseTool` and be placed in `src/Agents/tools/`.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for new logic in the `tests/unit` directory.
- **Linting**: We use Husky and lint-staged. Your code will be automatically formatted and linted on commit.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

- **Gateway**: The API entry point (`src/Gateway`).
- **Agents**: The brain of the operation (`src/Agents`).
- **Tools**: Specialized functions the agent can call (`src/Agents/tools`).
- **Registry**: Where tools and prompt templates are managed.
