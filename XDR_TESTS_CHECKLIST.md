## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If tests fail to start:
- [ ] Check Node.js version (v16+ recommended)
- [ ] Verify npm version (v8+ recommended)
- [ ] Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- [ ] Check jest.config.js exists and is valid

### If import errors occur:
- [ ] Verify @stellar/stellar-sdk is installed
- [ ] Check TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- [ ] Ensure ts-jest is installed and configured

### If tests timeout:
- [ ] Increase timeout in jest.config.js (testTimeout: 60000)
- [ ] Check network connectivity (if tests make external calls)
- [ ] Run tests individually to isolate slow tests

### If XDR validation fails:
- [ ] Verify Stellar SDK version matches expected (^14.4.3)
- [ ] Check network passphrase is correct
- [ ] Ensure keypairs are generated correctly
